KEYWORD ARGUEMENTS
 keyword argument consists of three elements:

 a keyword identifying the argument (end here);
 an equal sign (=); 
and a value assigned to that argument;

any keyword arguments have to be put after the last positional argument (this is very important)

## EXAMPLE 1

In our example, we have made use of the end keyword argument, and set it to a string containing one space.

## EXAMPLE 3
We said previously that the print() function separates its outputted arguments with spaces. This behavior can be changed, too.

The keyword argument that can do this is named sep (as in separator).
## EXAMPLE 4
Modify the code to output the following  using sep and end

## Example 5 


minimize the number of print() function invocations by inserting the \n sequence into the strings;
make the arrow twice as large (but keep the proportions)
duplicate the arrow, placing both arrows side by side; note: a string may be multiplied by using the following trick: "string" * 2 will produce "stringstring" (we'll tell you more about it soon)
remove any of the quotes, and look carefully at Python's response; pay attention to where Python sees an error ‒ is this the place where the error really exists?
do the same with some of the parentheses;
change any of the print words into something else, differing only in case (e.g., Print) ‒ what happens now?
replace some of the quotes with apostrophes; watch what happens carefully.
